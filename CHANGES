Release 0.1 (2014-03-29):
 * initial release. This release is a tentative release to get work on my
   libopenkey wrapper started. A lot of functionality for DESFire tags is still
   missing in this version. If you want to fiddle around with them, please wait
   for the next version of this wrapper.
