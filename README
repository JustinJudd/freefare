This is a Go wrapper for the libfreefare. It has been written against version
0.4.0 of the libfreefare but should work just fine with later versions. The code
is untested and should not be used in production code without further testing.

Please notice that this release is a tentative release to get work on my
libopenkey wrapper started. A lot of functionality for DESFire tags is still
missing in this version. If you want to fiddle around with them, please wait for
the next version of this wrapper.

The current release of this wrapper is release 0.1. Successive releases will be
placed in different subfolders as to not change the semantics of code that links
against a specific version of this wrapper. The general folder structure is

    github.com/fuzxxl/freefare/<version>/freefare

The following versions are special:

* latest always points to the latest version
* dev is the version that is currently written on.
