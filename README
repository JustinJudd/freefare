This is a Go wrapper for the libfreefare. It has been written against version
0.4.0 of the libfreefare but should work just fine with later versions. The code
is untested and should not be used in production code without further testing.

Please notice that this release contains a possibly memory corrupting issue in
freefare.DESFireTag.ReadData() and freefare.DESFireTag.ReadRecords(). This issue
is caused by a bug in the libfreefare and will be fixed as soon as the authors
of the libfreefare provide me with more information.

The current release of this wrapper is release 0.2. Successive releases will be
placed in different subfolders as to not change the semantics of code that links
against a specific version of this wrapper. The general folder structure is

    github.com/fuzxxl/freefare/<version>/freefare

The following versions are special:

* latest always points to the latest version
* dev is the version that is currently under development
